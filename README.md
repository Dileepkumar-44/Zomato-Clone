# Zomato Clone Website

Welcome to my Zomato Clone, a modern web application designed to bring the restaurant discovery and food ordering experience to your screen. This project showcases my ability to build full-stack applications that combine clean design, efficient functionality, and real-time user interaction.

The application allows users to explore nearby restaurants, browse menus, and place food orders online with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. It replicates the essential features of Zomato, including restaurant listings, search and filter options, user authentication, and cart management. Each restaurant page displays detailed information such as cuisine type, pricing, and customer ratings, making it easy for users to decide where and what to eat.

The frontend is built using React.js, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and dynamic user experience across all devices. The Node.js and Express.js backend handles API requests, user authentication, and data flow between the client and server efficiently. All restaurant, menu, and user data are stored securely in MongoDB, ensuring fast access and scalability.
